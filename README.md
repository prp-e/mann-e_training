For more information on the _self instruct_ process, please read [this article](https://haghiri75.com/en/re-creating-midjourney-with-only-10-technical-report-for-mann-e-5-development/)

## The Dataset

The data includes 720 images generated by [Midjourney version 5.0](https://midjourney.com) and the prompts are provided in this repository. The set of photos is humongos and it will be released in another server very soon. Currently, you can access the prompt data in the `data.xlsx` file and you can use them in Midjourney in order to get the same dataset.
